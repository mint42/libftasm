# LIBFTASM

Libftasm is an introduction to assembly programming. This project has a recreation of some basic functions from the C stdlib.

## Getting Started

To set up this project, run `git clone https://github.com/mint42/libftasm` in the folder of your choice. You can then run `make` in the root of that repository which will use the Makefile to build the library.

## Functions
